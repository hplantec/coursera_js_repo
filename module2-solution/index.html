                <div class="box-content">
                    A delicious chicken that once was joyously running around with its farm friends, and will melt on your tongue.

                <div class="box-content">
                    A weirdly good tasting beef, insured without any horse meat. With this meal you will travel through space and time to meet the local breeders.
                    Do not hesitate to ask our crew about the animal's life!

                <div class="box-content">
                    A fish-and-rice-based meal, your traditional japanese sushi. Except it's been made by an italian chef, using eastern european fish.
                    Probably fished using giant nests with more pointlessly killed fishes than actually harvested ones.
                    Plus the fishermen probably pissed in the sea, so I wouldn't recommend this one.
